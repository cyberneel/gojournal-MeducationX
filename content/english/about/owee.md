&emsp;I am always up for a challenge and love to learn new things. Along with my desire to become a surgeon in the future, I love researching about various science related topics. Some of my hobbies and interests include karate, art, and trying new foods. My favorite subject is chemistry. I hope to bring my skills into the team as an asset to make MeducationX grow even more.
