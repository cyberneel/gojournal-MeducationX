&emsp;As the Founder and President of MeducationX, Sahad embarked on this journey driven by a profound curiosity about the medical field. He had countless medical questions and realized that he would delve into medical articles and books to seek answers. It struck him that if he was going to explore and understand these topics, he might as well create a platform to share his findings and insights with others. His mission at MeducationX is to not only quench his own thirst for knowledge in the medical field but also to inform and educate fellow enthusiasts. Alongside his passion for medicine, Sahad holds interests in cell research, cars, Formula 1, psychology, and Pathology. When he's not immersed in the world of healthcare and education, you'll find him indulging in hobbies such as suturing, expanding his horizons through audiobooks, enjoying the thrill of ice hockey, practicing Taekwondo, and challenging his mind with chess. Together, he aims to foster a community of learners and knowledge seekers at MeducationX.
