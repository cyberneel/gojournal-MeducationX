&emsp;I am a creative and academically inclined person. Holding a youth membership, I have also received UNESCO certifications in classical dance. Beyond dance, I engage in sketching real-life portraits, photography, and poetry. My interest in psychology, specifically autism, adds depth to my pursuits. Looking ahead, my goal is to contribute to the field of biotechnology, driven by a longstanding interest in research and the transformative potential of biotechnology in healthcare. In doing so, I like to explore ways to address societal challenges through innovative solutions.
